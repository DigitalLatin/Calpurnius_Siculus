               <p>The seven eclogues of Calpurnius and the four of Nemesianus are preserved in the
                  same manuscripts, which is how it happens that they are always published together
                  by scholar, even though they differ in terms of refinement and charm. Add to this
                  the fact that many who use inferior manuscripts that attribute the eleven eclogues
                  to Calpurnius alone say that Nemesianus did not write any eclogues. From the time
                  of [Taddeo] Ugoleto there has been no lack of those who divide the poems between
                  Calpurnius and Nemesianus, assigning the last four to the latter, but until
                  recently they thought that Calpurnius had sent his poems to Nemesianus. But

                  those eleven eclogues belong neither to one poet nor to the same period, but
                  rather that the first seven should be assigned to Calpurnius and the rest to
                  Nemesianus. He also demonstrated that Calpurnius lived under the reign of Nero,
                  but Nemesianus lived in the time of Carus and his sons. Haupt's opinion, which

                  against in vain, now deservedly has the greatest authority among scholars.
                  Nevertheless, both because of the similarity in subject matter and the fact that
                  the condition of the text is the same in both poets' eclogues, I prefer to place
                  Calpurnius side-by-side with Nemesianus.</p>
