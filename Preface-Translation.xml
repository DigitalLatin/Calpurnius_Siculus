               <p>The seven eclogues of Calpurnius and the four of Nemesianus are preserved in the
                  same manuscripts, which is how it happens that they are always published together
                  by scholar, even though they differ in terms of refinement and charm. Add to this
                  the fact that many who use inferior manuscripts that attribute the eleven eclogues
                  to Calpurnius alone say that Nemesianus did not write any eclogues. From the time
                  of [Taddeo] Ugoleto there has been no lack of those who divide the poems between
                  Calpurnius and Nemesianus, assigning the last four to the latter, but until
                  recently they thought that Calpurnius had sent his poems to Nemesianus. But

                  those eleven eclogues belong neither to one poet nor to the same period, but

                  Nemesianus. He also demonstrated that Calpurnius lived under the reign of Nero,
                  but Nemesianus lived in the time of Carus and his sons. Haupt's opinion, which

                  against in vain, now deservedly has the greatest authority among scholars.
                  Nevertheless, both because of the similarity in subject matter and the fact that
                  the condition of the text is the same in both poets' eclogues, I prefer to place
                  Calpurnius side-by-side with Nemesianus.</p>

            <div type="section" n="2">
               <head>II.</head>
               <p>There are three closely related families of manuscripts of Calpurnius and
                  Nemesianus, in particular all of those that trace their origin back to three books
                  copied from the same archetype. The first family includes two manuscripts that
                  should be considered the best witnesses of all, since they are nearly free of
                  interpolations, even though they rather frequently show blemishes from the
                  ignorance and carelessness of their copyists. Many manuscripts conform to the
                  so-called family <ref target="#V">V</ref>. Their extraordinary agreement in many
                  errors demonstrates that all of them emanate from one book, which is also clear
                  enough from the sheer abundance of interpolations that are unique to this family.
                  And yet, these manuscripts are not corrupted in the same manner, but they can be
                  divided into distinct groups, which seems to me a tedious business and hardly
                  worthwhile. Besides, <bibl><author>Schenkl</author> (<title level="j">Wiener
                        Studien</title>
                     <biblScope unit="volume">V</biblScope>
                     <biblScope unit="page">p. 294 sqq.</biblScope>
                     <date>1883</date></bibl> and on page 50ff. of the preface to his first edition
                  ) has distinguished two families, <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                     >w</hi>, but I wish he had not. It is easy for me to agree with that most
                  learned man concerning the group that is called <hi rend="italic">w</hi>; but with
                  regard to the manuscripts that he denotes with the letter <hi rend="italic"
                  >v</hi>, it is impossible to know that all of them are of the same kind when only
                  a few readings have been received full scrutiny. But one manuscript is assigned to
                  the third family because it presents very many errors that the other manuscripts
                  lack entirely. Moreover, a good number of readings are found in it that are
                  characteristic of the better manuscripts, but it has none in common with the
                  inferior manuscripts. For this reason it occupies a kind of middle ground, so to
                  speak, between the books of good repute and those that have been corrupted.
                  Indeed, readings have been selected for these books from the German manuscript of
                  Thadeus Ugoletus and from the manuscript belonging to Boccaccio, and various
                  excerpts should be added, too. I will consider these matters below.</p>

               <p>Now it is necessary to discuss the manuscripts of the first family: <ref
                     target="#N">N = Neapolitanus V a 8</ref> and <ref target="#G">G = Gaddianus
                     Laur. plut. 90, 12 inf.</ref></p>
               <p>Codex Neapolitanus V a 8, formerly 280, parchment, 261 X 160 mm., written at about
                  the beginning of the fifteenth century. It consists of 116 leaves, of which 1–36a
                  contain Cato's <hi rend="italic">De Agricultura</hi>; 20–101a, Varro's <hi
                     rend="italic">De Re Rustica</hi>; 101a–115b, the <hi rend="italic">Bucolic</hi>
                  of Calpurnius and Nemesianus. The remaining leaves are blank. Each page has
                  thirty-eight verses. With respect to correcting hands, the manuscript put two in
                  particular to the test. The first belongs to the original copyist. The manuscript
                  was corrected again around the same time, but here and there the second hand
                  cannot easily be distinguished from the first. A third hand's emendations can be
                  discerned in only a few places. The individual poems lack titles, but they are
                  separated from each other by brief spaces. The following subscription appears at
                  the end of the whole work: <hi rend="italic">Aureliani Nemesiani Cartag&#773;
                     bucol&#8217; explicit: Deo gratias amen</hi>. Finally, another more recent
                  hand, as Bursian and Schenkl recognized, wrote <hi rend="italic">Calpurnii
                     eclogae</hi> et <hi rend="italic">Nemesiani eclogae</hi>.</p>
               <p>We know nothing about the origin and provenance of this manuscript except what is
                  understood from the following passages written on the last leaf: "Joannes Antonius
                  Perillus, a nobleman of Naples and most learned gentleman, gave this book to Jacob
                  Perillus in 1667 on the first of June," and a little below, "This book belongs to
                  Antonius Seripandus, received as a gift from his best friend Jacob Perillus."
                  Later it was brought to the library of San Giovanni a Carbonara, and from there it
                  came to the greatest library in Naples, formerly known as the <orgName

                     <persName>Jacques Philippe D'Orville</persName> was the first to collate this
                  manuscript carefully enough for <persName>Pieter Burmann's</persName> use; his
                  collation appears in the <ref

                     Bursian</persName> examined it on behalf of <persName>Moriz Haupt</persName>,
                  but nothing is known about the worth of his collation, since the edition promissed
                  by Haupt was never published. <persName>Baehrens</persName> was the next to use
                  it, but in way that rightly earned the scorn of <persName>Schenkl</persName>, who
                  collated the manuscript in 1878 and inspected it again a few years later when
                  preparing his <ref target="#Schenkl2">second edition of Calpurnius and
                     Nemesianus</ref>. For my part, I examined the entire manuscript in 1907, but to
                  remove all of the discrepancies between my collation and the testimony of Schenkl,
                  in the summer of 1909 my friend <persName ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/311005886"
                     >Giampietro Zottoli</persName> inspected with me all of the places where
                     <persName>Schenkl</persName> had a different reading, and we often uncovered
                  carelessness on <persName>Schenkl</persName>'s part. I have published in my
                  apparatus criticus the entire collation of his manuscript, omitting not even the
                  slightest thing to do with orthography.</p>
               <p xml:id="CodexGaddianus">Codex Gaddianus Laurentianus plut. 90, 12 inf., paper, 294
                  X 225 mm., written at the beginning of the fifteenth century, consists of 74
                  leaves. It contains the twelve eclogues of Francesco Petrarch (ff. 1–44), the
                        <bibl><title>Culex</title></bibl> of Vergilius Maro, the
                        <bibl><title>Dirae</title></bibl> of Vergilius Maro (ff. 52–55), and
                  Calpurnius and Nemesianus (ff. 55–74). A very brief, unattributed ecloque follows
                  with the interlocutors Daphnis, Tityrus, Mopsus, and
                  Meliboeus<!-- should these be encoded with <persName>? -->. Individual pages
                  generally have twenty-nine versus, but some vary, with the shorter ones having
                  twenty-six and the longer ones haveing thirty-two verses. The following
                  inscription has been added to the eclogues of Calpurnius: <quote>The Eclogues of
                     Calfurnius to Nemesianus of Carthage</quote>. Nemesianus follows Calpurnius
                  with the following title prefixed: <quote>Here begin the eclogues of Aurelianus
                     Nemesianus of Carthage</quote>. At the end of each eclogue there appears an <hi
                     rend="italic">explicit</hi> with the number of each eclogue, but Calpunrius'
                  sixth eclogue lacks a subscription, and the following is written at the end of the
                  seventh: <quote>Here ends the sixth eclogue of Calphurnius</quote>. This is
                  explained by the fact that the seventh eclogue follows the sixth without any
                  break, with the result that only six eclogues are attributed to Calpurnius in this
                  manuscript. But in the margin, where the sixth eclogue ought to end, the copyist
                  has added the following: <quote>Some wish to say that the eclogue that begins <hi
                        rend="italic">lentus</hi> is a completely different eclogue; others say that
                     it is the same, etc.</quote></p>
               <p>In this manuscript the copyist himself added almost all of the corrections either
                  by removing scribal errors in the verses or adding variant readings to the margin.
                  But there are some that seem to have been made by another hand. The manuscript was
                  mentioned by <bibl><editor><ref target="#Glaeser">Glaeser</ref></editor></bibl>
                  and <bibl><author><ref target="#Haupt">Haupt</ref></author></bibl>, but
                           <bibl><editor><ref target="#Baehr.">Baehrens</ref></editor></bibl> was
                  the first to examine it, far too hurriedly; <bibl><editor><ref target="#Schenkl"
                           >Schenkl</ref></editor></bibl> was the next to use it, much more
                  carefully. I myself transcribed the manuscript in 1908 with as much attentiveness
                  as I could, but I collated it again in the following year, to settle all of the
                  discrepancies with <ref target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref>. Still, there are very
                  many places that <ref target="Schenkl">Schenkl</ref> has reported erroneously, as
                  you can gather from my notes, for I have taken greatest pains to publish all of
                  the readings of this manuscript, too.</p>
               <p>Having described the outer appearance of manuscripts N and G and explained their
                  provenance, I must now discuss in more detail their relationship and their
                  importance. Until now, no one except Baehrens and Schenkl has examined the
                  authority of either manuscript. It is no wonder, since Baehrens was the first to
                  collate the Gaddianus, and no one before Glaeser considered the Neapolitanus of
                  much value. But Baehrens and Schenkl held different opinions: the former, as
                  usual, overvalues the manuscript that he was the first to publish and argues that
                  the Gaddianus is superior to the others; the latter, however, prefers the
                  Neapolitanus. But Baehrens asserts his point of view instead of demonstrating it
                  with strong evidence. On the other hand, Schenkl tried to demonstrate that the
                  Gaddianus admitted interpolations in some places. It seems to me that neither one
                  has hit upon the truth entirely, as I think the following makes clear.</p>
               <p>I have already said that both manuscripts descend from the same archetype, and
                  that is supported by the very large number of readings that N has in common with
                  G, when something else is written in the rest of the manuscripts. But, to be fair,
                  they differ among themselves in many places, and it is right to discuss their
                  differences so that it will be easier to see which manuscript departs less from
                  the archetype. In doing this, I take no account of readings that are attributed to
                  the second or third hand in the Neapolitanus or of the various readings that the
                  copyist added in the margin of the Gaddianus. I shall consider them later.</p>
               <p>But first of all, although the repute of each of the two manuscripts is frequently
                  distorted because of the carelessness and ignorance of the copyists, it seems to
                  me that the Gaddianus was copied a little more carelessly. For instance, four
                  verses (C. 1.40, 4.16, 4.123; N. 1.73) are missing from it, and Nemesianus 2.49
                  has been placed after verse 45: Moreover, the following words have been omitted:
                  C. 1.92 <quote>ipsa</quote>, 2.88 <quote>quotiens</quote>, 3.23
                     <quote>deus</quote>, 3.3 <quote>sed</quote>, 3.89 <quote>non</quote>. But in
                  the Neapolitan manuscript, no verse is missing (it is unnecessary, I think, for me
                  to remind you that I speak here about the unique defects of each manuscript, not
                  about the common defects that are rightly assigned to the archetype), but C.
                  1.31–32 have been inverted and N. 2.81 were inserted after 3.16. Then the copyist
                  overlooked the following words: C. 6.46 <quote>pignus</quote>, 6.90
                     <quote>hoc</quote>, N. 1.23 <quote>et</quote>, 1.71 <quote>et</quote>, 3.5
                     <quote>ex tereti</quote>, 4.60 <quote>audit</quote>. Add to this the fact that
                  in almost 130 places N offers the correct reading and G an erroneous one, and the
                  opposite happens a little less frequently.</p>
               <p>Each of the two manuscripts has some errors (N has more by far) in common with V,
                  which could not have happened always entirely by chance. The following places are
                  clearly due to interpolation: C. 2.73 <quote>cicius</quote> or <quote>citius

                  examples are either doubtful or should be disregarded entirely.</p>
               <p>Next, some have deemed the following places in G as possibly
                  suspicious:<!-- Maybe do this as a list? --> C I 12 <quote>errantes</quote>, 85
                     <quote>accipiet</quote>, III 20 <quote>invenias</quote>, IV 2

                  52, <quote>quod</quote>, VI 59 <quote>mascillo</quote>, VII 11
                     <quote>herus</quote>, 26 <quote>in</quote>, 41 <quote>non</quote>, N. I 2
                     <quote>raris</quote>, 5 <quote>flavit</quote>, 16 <quote>carmina</quote>, 63
                     <quote>carmina</quote>, 82 <quote>canis</quote>, II 27 <quote>nostri

                     <quote>discedere</quote>, III 52 <quote>saliensque liquore</quote>. But
                     <quote>enim</quote>, <quote>pascua</quote>, <quote>mascillo</quote>,
                     <quote>in</quote>, <quote>canis</quote> are without doubt glosses inserted
                  later in place of the poets' words. One could say the same thing about
                     <quote>accipiet</quote>, <quote>ethera</quote>, <quote>discedere</quote>. Also
                     <quote>aethera</quote> and <quote>discedere</quote> are just as good as
                     <quote>aera</quote> and <quote>descendere</quote>, and for a long time I was
                  not sure which of the two I preferred. And <quote>liquide</quote>,
                     <quote>primum</quote>, <quote>flavit</quote>, <quote>carmina</quote> (N. I 16)
                  should not be considered interpolations, but rather corruptions that arose in
                  these places since the words that should have been written by the copyist appeared
                  nearby. Thus, <quote>liquide</quote> is derived from <quote>dulce</quote>,
                     <quote>primum</quote> from <quote>spatium</quote>, <quote>flavit</quote> from
                     <quote>inflare</quote>, <quote>carmina</quote> from <quote>carmine</quote>. But
                     <quote>carmina</quote> (N. 1.63) is either a gloss or a corruption that owes
                  its origin from the initial sound of the next word, and <quote>corpore</quote> and
                     <quote>robore</quote> are very often confused in the manuscripts. Then there
                  are these words: <quote>herus</quote>, <quote>raris</quote>, <quote>omnes</quote>.
                  One would hardly believe that they were made by an interpolator since they do are
                  meaningless. But for the most part, the rest of the examples can be attributed to
                  an interpolator. The following places in N should be considered: C. 1.13
                     <quote>sequar</quote>, 4.46 <quote>inter nostras</quote>, 4.136 <quote>pede
                     velox</quote>, 4.153 <quote>in</quote>, 4.164 <quote>vestros</quote>, N. 2.71
                     <quote>ducas</quote>. <quote>in</quote> is a gloss. <quote>ducas</quote> is
                  closer to <quote>ducam</quote>, which the inferior manuscripts have, than to
                     <quote>duco</quote>, which G correctly offers. <quote>vestros</quote> is owed
                  to an interpolator. The rest are uncertain.</p>
               <p>Finally, the writings of both manuscripts have been corrupted in various was, but
                  sometimes they betray an infelicitous effort at emendation. I would like you to
                  consider the following places, for it is not necessary to say anything about the
                  rest): C. 1.90 <quote>querit</quote> N, <quote>petit</quote> G; 2.96
                     <quote>o</quote> G; 3.50 <quote>turbidus</quote> G; 4.63 <quote>carmen
                     modulavit</quote> G; 4.125 <quote>placanda</quote> G; 5.15
                     <quote>montibus</quote> G; 5.16 <quote>cecinere</quote> G; 5.104
                     <quote>nectendum</quote> N, <quote>videndum</quote> G; N. 2.30 <quote>nullo
                     sudarunt</quote> G, 4.28 <quote>volucrum tum</quote> G; 4.39
                     <quote>subeunte</quote> G. Indeed it is hardly the case that all of these
                  places are equally suspicious, for <quote>o</quote> is a gloss, and I do not think
                  one should think otherwise about <quote>carmen modulavit</quote>. But
                     <quote>turbidus</quote> is clearly an interpolation, which I could hardly say
                  about <quote>volucrum tum</quote>. Then <quote>querit</quote> and
                     <quote>petit</quote> perhaps stem from a poorly understood abbreviation of the
                  word <quote>quatit</quote>, but that gives me pause. But the other examples, with
                  due respect to Schenkl, are hardly attributable to interpolators, unless you
                  happen to think that those interpolators were completely ignorant of the Latin
                  language.</p>
               <p>But before we pass judgment on the authority of manuscripts N and G, we must say a
                  few things about the corrections that each manuscript underwent.</p>
               <p>Manuscript N, as we said above, was emended rather often by the original copyist
                  and others. But all of the emendations of the first hand, which I have detected in
                  almost sixty places, arose from the archetype itself. The copyist, as often
                  happens, sometimes corrected the more trivial scribal errors as he wrote; we are
                  all used to making these errors when we write. Accordingly, he added letters that
                  he omitted by writing too quickly, or he delected extra letters, or he changed
                  vowels and consonants, or he added words that had been omitted, or he restored the
                  order of verses, or he inserted notes about people. Since that is the case, nearly
                  all of the emendations by the first hand are good, or, to state it more
                  truthfully, they restore the wording of the archetype. At C. 1.20, the first hand
                  corrected <quote>dipicta</quote> to <quote>depicta</quote>, which <ref
                     target="#Jacoby">Jacoby</ref> recently defended in vain, since
                     <quote>descripta</quote> is to be read without doubt (cfr. Verg. Ecl. 5.13 and
                  Calp. 1.25), but <quote>depicta</quote> was in the archetype, as G shows us.
                  Similarly at N. 4.65 <quote>aversa</quote> is wrong (cfr. Verg. Ecl. 8.101 sq.),
                  and the first hand has changed the fault into <quote>adversa</quote>, but
                     <quote>adversa</quote> is found in G, from which you can easily conclude that
                  the same reading appeared in the archetype. Only once did the first hand corrupt
                  the true reading of the archetype (C. 3.67 <quote>qui</quote> from
                     <quote>quam</quote>), but that should be attributed to an abbreviation, not at
                  all to his intellect. Finally, all of the corrections of the first hand are
                  confirmed by the readings in manuscript G, with the exception of C. 1.24
                     <quote>propius</quote>, where I have reasonable suspicion that the person who
                  wrote G misread the word.</p>
               <p>The second hand's so-called emendations are three times as frequent as the first
                  hand's, but in terms of proportion, they are found much more often in Calpurnius
                  than in Nemesianus, and around a third of them are correct. For the most part, the
                  second hand corrects scribal errors of a more trivial sort, but sometimes it
                  restores omitted verses or errors, or it corrects transposed verses, or it
                  completely overhauls more serious problems. In general, the second hand's
                  emendations come from manuscripts of the second family, not the archetype, but an
                  interpolator has corrected some of them after his own fashion. It does not take
                  many examples to demonstrate this, but, to begin with passages successfully
                  restored, consider these readings with me, dear reader:</p>

               <p>On the other hand, an interpolator has cleverly emended the following:C. 3.91

               <p>Do it not seem to you that I have demonstrated what I set out to prove? Or does it

                  examples. First of all, in following places the second hand of manuscript N
                  substituted the interpolations that mar the manuscripts in V for the genuine

               <p>And so if the second hand's emendations agree with manuscripts of family V, they
                  can add no authority to them, since they arose from them; but if they depend on no
                  other book, they must be considered to be the conjectures of a fairly learned
                  person. If we have discussed them correctly, the emendations of that sort are
                  entirely without merit, and I did not unjustly omit them outright when I compared
                  manuscript N with G.</p>
               <p>Finally, there are five emendations by the third hand, of which three are good (C.
                  2.1 puer, 2.4 gravis, 2.33 pomona) and two are bad (C. 1.59 truderit, 5.11
                  ganā).</p>
               <p>Manuscript G offers more than eighty emendations in its own <!-- contextu -->.
                  With two or three exceptions where you can recognize another hand, they are the
                  work of the original copyist. Sometimes, he restored verses or words that had been
                  omitted, but for the most part he corrected the more trivial scribal errors. All
                  of the corrections are good, and they are derived from the archetype itself (as
                  agreement with its twin manuscript shows), with only three exceptions: N. 2.73,
                  3.63, 4.10, which the scribe unsucessfully tried to emend. N. 3.53 does not count,
                  since in this passage either the copyist of manuscript N could read poorly, or G
                  entered a correction made either above the line or in the margin of the archetype.
                  But aside from these emendations I found nearly alternate readings in the margine
                  of this manuscript, which most often were added by the copyist himself. All are
                  derived either from some manuscript of no special repute or from the conjecture of
                  some lscholar. For the most part, they are not even worthy of mention.</p>
               <p>If I have done my job, it is clear what we should think about each of these
                  manuscripts. Manuscripts N and G outstrip the others not only in the good quality
                  of their archetype, but also because their copyists were content to transcribe the
                  archetype faithfully, and they generally abstained from interpolating the words of
                  the poets. For very rarely have the words handed down from antiquity been
                  corrupted by the judgment of the scribes. That is why this is the biggest
                  difference between the Neapolitanus and the Gaddianus: that the latter generally
                  <!-- temptavit --> the writing of the archetype by his own devices, but the former
                  admitted the interpolations of inferior manuscripts. And, if we want to think
                  clearly, the Neapolitanus should be preferred in a certain way, but not as Schenkl
                  wanted. For the Gaddianus has nearly the same number of good readings as the
                  Neapolitanus, and sometimes it alone out of all of the manuscripts preserves the
                  genuine reading for us. And so, there is need for both manuscripts in representing
                  the true picture of the archetype.</p>

                     the mistake. Now I return to what I started. The eleven eclogues of Calpunrius
                     are contained in this manuscript (ff. 25–45), along with other minor works of
                     various authors that are not worth mentioning here, since the poems of
                     Calpurnius, as Schenkl knew, were formerly separated from the rest. And
                     Calpurnius' bucolic poetry includes such a large number of corrections and
                     glosses added by various hands either in the verses themselves or in the margin
                     that the various hands cannot always be distinguished among themselves. But
                     that is as much as I will say, since I propose to discuss the annotations of
                     Angelius elsewhere.</item>
                  <item>Codex Riccardianus 974, paper, 208 X 142 mm., written in the fifteenth
                     century, consists of 74 leaves. Among other minor works of various authors, it
                     contains only the second eclogue by Calpurnius (ff. 3–5), and that under the
                     title of the first eclogue. Previous editors clearly did not know about this
                     manuscript.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I have added three other manuscripts, namely Gothanus 55 and the two
                  Wratislavienses Rehdigerani, I.4.10 and I.4.11, but I have not inspected them
                  personally.</p>
               <p>Regarding the codex Gothanus, Wernsdor reported the following: <quote>"Written on

                  Calpurnius. It was beautifully written , but finished recently, scarcely before
                  the fifteenth century. Moreover, it has been damaged, or it was copied from a
                  damaged manuscript, since the seventh eclogue ends at verse 65. After an empty
                  space on the last part of the page, the copyist has written the following
                  subscription: <quote>The end. These are the poems that were composed by
                     Calpurnius</quote>. I. G. Meusel collated the manuscript for Wernsdorf.</p>
               <p><ref target="#Glaeser">Glaeser</ref> had the following to say about the codices
                  Rehdigerani: <quote>The second codex Rehdigeranus (that is, I.4.11), retrieved
                     from the Rehdigeran library in this city (i.e., Wrocław), quarto, written
                     carelessly in the fifteenth century, 115 leaves. All eleven are ascribed to
                     Calpurnius. They are preserved on leaves 3ʳ–22ʳ. Aside from one inscription at
                     the beginning, no other is found in this book, and no indication of characters,
                     with the exception of the recto of the third leaf. Here, the copyist put this
                     sign (") in the margin when the character changes. Individual pages have
                     twenty-six verses. Although this book contains many erroneous readings, I can
                     assert that good readings are not entirely missing from it. I have collated it
                     myself." "I received permission to use the first codex Rehdigeranus (that is,
                     I.4.10) from the Rehdigeran library that is in this city. It is a quarto volume
                     of mixed material (paper and parchment), beautifully written in the fifteenth
                     century. It consists of 130 leaves. It contains all eleven eclogues assigned to
                     Calpurnius. They appear on leave 3ʳ–27ʳ. Titles and signs for characters are
                     decorated with red ink. Each page has twenty-two or twenty-three verses.
                     Additionally, many of the minor poems of Vergil and other others (some more
                     recent) are written in it. I collated it myself."</quote></p>
               <p>All of the manuscripts that I have assigned to the second family were copied from
                  one book, which I will call <ref target="#V">V</ref>, or from a copy of it. The
                  common origin of these manuscripts is attested not only by the omission or
                  transposition of the same verses and words, but also by the great number of
                  interpolations and errors that the other manuscripts lack entirely. But aside from
                  these common faults, which were transmitted from the archetype, the individual
                  manuscripts have many other errors unique to themselves. Through careful
                  comparison, these books can be assigned to specific groups. For that reason, I
                  don't want to linger on this subject, but I will advise that Riccadianus 724 and
                  Vaticanus Reginensis 1759 are so similar to each other that you would rightly
                  conclude: that they were copied from the same book; that the Ottobonianus,
                  Laurentianus pl. 37,14, the first Rehdigeranus (I.4.10), the Gothanus, and the <hi
                     rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> descended from the same copy of manuscript
                     <ref target="#V">V</ref> on account of certain evidence; and finally that
                  Vaticanus Urbinas 353 and the <hi rend="italic">editio Veneta</hi> in 1472 are
                  closely related by the tightest bonds of affinity. For the oldest editions are
                  rightly thought to be reproductions of manuscripts (cfr. <ref target="#Sabbadini"
                     >Sabbadini</ref>, p. 213 n. 5); moreover, the <hi rend="italic">editio
                     Veneta</hi> was printed before Fridericus de Veteranis transcribed the Codex
                  Urbinas (cfr. <ref target="#Curcio">Curcio</ref>, p. VIII). Finally, I add that I
                  found the oldest edition of Calpurnius and Nemesianus in the Bibliotheca
                  Riccardiana, recorded by no editor until now, place and year of publication
                  unknown, now bearing the number 498, which I can demonstrate by the strongest of
                  arguments was copied from the manuscript Laurentianus pl. 37,14 before that
                  manuscript underwent the corrections of the so-called second hand.</p>
               <p>If any one should collate all of the manuscripts of this family with care, he
                  would easily know which readings are those of the archetype from which all of them
                  originate, and which are owed to the copyists of the individual manuscripts. And
                  so now it remains to comapre <ref target="#V">V</ref> with <ref target="#N"
                     >N</ref> and <ref target="#G">G</ref> and to see quat authority should be
                  attributed to them.</p>
               <p>First of all, both families, but more often <ref target="#V">V</ref>, are marred
                  with gaps in verses and words. Eleven versus are missing in <ref target="#V"
                     >V</ref> (C. 1.51, 7.32–34, 7.52–54, N. 1.29, 2.83, 3.25, 3.30) and one verse
                  has been made from the two verses C. 2.18–19. On the other hand, C. 1.42 is
                  missing in <ref target="#N">N</ref> and <ref target="#G">G</ref>, and the
                  following words have been omitted: C. 4.94 <quote>posito</quote>, 7.71
                     <quote>et</quote>, N. 3.6 <quote>hanc pueri tamquam</quote>. Moreover, in <ref
                     target="#N">N</ref>
                  <ref target="G">G</ref> Calpurnius 5.7 is placed before 5.6 and in <ref
                     target="#V">V</ref> Calpurnius 5.67 is placed before 5.66. But since verses and
                  supplied words have been passed down from antiquity and cannot be attributed to
                  interpolators, the carelessness of copyists must not be blamed in these passages.
                  But with regard to the words <quote>(h)anc pueri tamquam</quote>, which were
                  omitted in <ref target="#N">N</ref>
                  <ref target="#G">G</ref> even though there was space for them, the copyist, in my
                  opinion, deliberately omitted them because he did not understand the writing in
                  the archetype.</p>
               <p><ref target="#N">N</ref>
                  <ref target="#G">G</ref> and <ref target="#V">V</ref> differ in two hundred places
                  or even more, but the readings correctly preserved in <ref target="#N">N</ref>
                  <ref target="#G">G</ref> are almost two times greater than those in the second
                  family. Moreover, what is even more interesting, nearly all of the corruptions
                  that blemish <ref target="#N">N</ref>
                  <ref target="#G">G</ref> are owed to the carelessness or ignorance of their
                  copyists, but <ref target="#V">V</ref> quite often underwent interpolations. For
                  example, there is no doubt that in <ref target="#N">N</ref>
                  <ref target="#G">G</ref> the following passages drew their flaws from either the
                  carelessness of a copyist or an abbreviation poorly understood: C. 1.28

                     <quote>visus</quote> C. 7.84 comes from the preceding verse. There are
                  certainly some passages that you could trace back to an interpolator: C. 1.20

                     <quote>subeunt(e)</quote>, but, from the perspective of the archetype, I would
                  attribute even these passages, with one or two exceptions, to the ignorance or
                  carelessness of a copyist.</p>
               <p>The same cannot be said about the archetype of the second family; indeed, things
                  could not be more different. To say nothing of glosses received into the text, or
                  words moved either because of the scribes' mistake or judgment (cfr C. 1.8–9, 2.4,
                  2.73, 3.74, 3.88, 4.76, 4.83, 7.83, N. 1.72, 2.1, 2.23, 2.33, 2.40, 2.47, 2.76,
                  4.54), and other faults that you could explain in various ways, I have detected
                  the following in particular in it, and it detracts greatly from its authority: I
                  refer to a great abundance of interpolations that have arisen only out of a
                  passion for making changes. And, just to dismiss the several passages that others
                  have ascribed to the carelessness of copyists, there is no reason to doubt that
                  the readings marshalled here are owed to an interpolator:

               <head>V. The Third Family</head>
               <p>Our only witness to the third family is codex Parisinus 8049, whose outer
                  appearance F. Buecheler described in his edition of Petronius (Berlin 1862, p.
                  XXf.) as follows: <quote>"Parchment, quarto, bound together in three parts: I.

                     Kelius, end of the 12th century, according to Froehnerus, the end of the second

                        <author>Cicero</author></bibl>. On the verso of leaf 17: <quote>Marci Tullii

                  this manuscript or one very similar to it, Poggio wrote the following to Noccolus
                  (Epist. 1.91) in 1423: <quote>Please send me Calpurnius'
                           <bibl><title>Bucolia</title></bibl> and the excerpt of Petronius that I
                     sent to you from England.</quote> (Cfr. <ref target="#Sabbadini"
                     >Sabbadini</ref> p. 83 n. 52). <ref target="#Pithou">Pithou</ref> was the first
                  to use this manuscript, then <ref target="#Heinsius">Heinsius</ref>, as it seems,
                  Miller (for <ref target="#Glaeser">Glaeser</ref>), Bursian (for <ref
                     target="#Haupt">Haupt</ref>), and <ref target="#Baehr.">Baehrens</ref> collated
                  it. Finally, at the request of <ref target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref>, Schoene
                  inspected many of its passages.</p>
               <p>The copyist who wrote the Codex Parisinus was utterly ignorant of the Latin
                  language. In his completely careless performance of his task he committed
                  countless scribal errors, and he did not finish his work, since the manuscript
                  contains the first three eclogues by Calpurnius and stops in mid-sentence at verse
                  12 of the fourth. Since I have mentioned all of the readings of this manuscript in
                  my apparatus criticus, there is no need to report here all of the defects of
                  writing with which it teems. But I will now recount certain rather curious things
                  that are unique to this manuscript, so that you will be all the more amazed at the
                  copyist's carelessness and ignorance:</p>

               <p>But despite such an abundance of errors, sometimes the Codex Parisinus reports a
                  correct reading of the archetype that has been corrupted in the other two
                  families: cfr. 2.14 <quote>naides</quote> P, <quote>naiades</quote> N V,
                     <quote>nayades</quote> G, 63 <quote>parilibus</quote> P,
                     <quote>paliribus</quote> N G, <quote>palilibus</quote> V. To those passage you
                  could add 1.4 <quote>ornyte</quote>*, <quote>ornyce</quote> P,
                     <quote>ornite</quote> N G V. Even if you grant that these passages could have
                  been emended by conjecture, nevertheless you would hardly think that a copyist
                  whose ignorance and carelessness we have detected in so many and such great
                  passages should be pardoned. If we have discussed these matters properly, all of
                  the interpolations that the manuscript underwent are owed to the archetype, but
                  the numerous mistakes in writing must be attributed to the copyist.</p>
               <p>But to make a better judgment about the worth of this manuscript, we should
                  consider what its readings are in the passages where the first family differs from
                  the second.</p>
               <p>First of all, N G P often give a good reading where V has a corrupt one:</p>

               <p>In conclusion, to review what has been accomplished in this discussion, where N
                  and G agree with P, there is not doubt that their reading should be preferred to
                  readings of the second family. We have seen that this rule is violated in only
                  three places (1.48 <quote>victas</quote>, 2.14 <quote>affuerant</quote>, 3.73
                     <quote>vi</quote>), with which I do not concern myself. But where N and G
                  differ from P and V, both groups of manuscripts have nearly the same number of
                  good and corrupt readings. But far be it from me to give equal authority to both
                  groups, for nearly all of the corruptions that N and G received, as it were, by
                  inheritance from the archetype of the first family are owed to the carelessness or
                  ignorance of copyists, but the faults of other manuscripts should be attributed to
                  the perverse zeal of pseudo-scholars for emending and interpolating. That is why,
                  with one or two exceptions, there is never any uncertainty about which reading to
                  select. If these matters have been established correctly, then the Codex Parisinus
                  cannot always be accepted as an arbiter, but we ought always to consider its
                  readings and we must also be sad that it has such a brief run of verses.</p>

               <head>VI. Two lost manuscripts</head>
               <p>Now let us discuss the two manuscripts that are lost to us today, that is the
                  Taddeo Ugoleto's Codex Germanicus and Boccaccio's manuscript.</p>
               <p>We know nothing about the Codex Germanicus other than what Niccolò Angeli has
                  handed down to us about it. Also, the following is written in Codex Riccardianus
                  636 at the end of Calpurnius in the hand of Angeli: <quote>From a very ancient
                     manuscript brought from Germany | this title has been copied: The end of the
                     bucolics of | Calpurnius, the first eclogue of Aurelius Nemesianus the poet |
                     from Carthage</quote>. Then, at the end of Nemesianus: <quote>I, Niccolò
                     Angeli, collated this manuscript against many others and the very old
                     manuscript that Taddeo Ugoleto, librarian of the royal library in Hungary,
                     brought with him from Germany and prepared for my use. Many poems were
                     discovered in it. In the year of salvation 1492</quote>. Regarding Boccaccio's
                  manuscript, Codex Harleianus 2578 (about which see <bibl><author>C.
                        Schenkl</author> in the preface to his edition of Ausonius [Berlin 1884], p.
                     XXI)</bibl> offers similar testimony. At the end of Nemesianus, the following
                  subscription is found: <quote>This manuscript was collated with greatest care with
                     the very old manuscript that Taddeo Ugoleto, librarian of the royal library in
                     Hungary, brought from Germany. Also with the one that Giovanni Boccaccio is
                     said to have written with his own hand to dedicate to the library of Santo
                     Spirito in Florence: We found the title and division of the work in that
                     manuscript, along with many poems.</quote></p>
               <p>Codex Riccardianus 636 is written very beautifully on the leaves that contain the
                  bucolic poetry of Calpurnius and Nemesianus, but at a later date, by erasing or
                  emending, various hands have obscured the transmitted text to such a degree that
                  sometimes you can barely see what the original reading was. Moreover, because of
                  their similarities, I could not, like Schenkl, always distinguish the later hands.
                  That is why I have indicated all of them, except Angeli's readings, in the
                  apparatus criticus with the symbol <ref target="#ρ2">ρ²</ref>. For the hand of
                  Angeli is easily distinguished from the others in nearly all instances. And now we
                  must consider his readings to make a proper judgment about the authority of the
                  Codex Germanicus, since we learn nothing from the edition published in Parma
                  (around 1500) or the first Florentine edition (1504), even though Angeli edited
                  the latter and Angelo Ugoleto added at the end of the former that he had
                  established the text based on the Codex Germanicus, when both editions, as Schenkl
                  has demonstrated conclusively, derived from Codex Riccardianus 636.</p>
               <p>First to consider is whether all of the readings noted by Angeli were taken from
                  the Codex Germanicus or had some other origin. In the subcription of the Codex
                  Riccardianus that we reported above <!-- refer to this --> there is mention of
                  many other manuscripts. Moreover, Angeli's annotations can be divided generally
                  into two classes, for most of them agree with N G, and the rest with certain
                  manuscripts of the second family, especially Codex Urbinas 353 Vatican 3152,
                  Ambrosianus O.74 sup., and the edition published in Venice in 1472. Consider the

                  from the same archetype as N and G, and that the readings that agree with N and G
                  should be attributed to that archetype, but that Angeli copied the rest of the
                  readings from interpolated manuscripts. The inference is supported by the fact
                  that Angeli discloses in the subscription to the Codex Riccardianus that he used
                  other manuscripts, too. This agrees with the fact that in the Codex Germanicus, as
                  attested by Niccolò Angeli at the end of Calpurnius in the codex Riccardianus and
                  Angelo Ugoleto at the end of the original from Parma, the four later poems were
                  attributed to Nemesianus. N and G divide the eleven eclogues between Calpurnius
                  and Nemesianus in the same way, but all of them are attributed to Calpurnius alone
                  in the manuscripts of the second family. Therefore the Codex Germanicus should
                  certainly be assigned to the first family. But could it not happen that the Codex
                  Germanicus underwent some interpolations? Indeed it could have happened, but since
                  the task of seeking out a semblance of the lost manuscript is a very risky
                  venture, even though the inference seems probably to me, I nevertheless prefer to
                  report all of Angeli's readings without distinction under the symbol <ref
                     target="#A">A</ref>. And I feel so strongly about the authority of the Codex
                  Germanicus that when it agrees with N or G, it offers us another witness to the
                  first family, and when it agrees with V, it has the same force as a manuscript of
                  the second family. For Angeli's annotations hardly ever differ from all of the
                  manuscripts: Calp. 1.45 <quote>in ulnis</quote>, 1.86 <quote>tralati</quote>, 2.3
                     <quote>nec</quote>, 4.86 <quote>in</quote>, 5.65 <quote>tinniat ore</quote>,
                  5.79 <quote>et vitrosa</quote>, 5.104 <quote>hic</quote>, 7.59
                     <quote>manticoram</quote>, Nemes. 1.70 <quote>hinc</quote>, 2.41
                     <quote>horti</quote>, 2.83 <quote>qui</quote>. But sometimes the Codex
                  Germanicus alone among all manuscripts preserves for us the true reading or traces
                  of the true reading, as at Calp. 2.3 <quote>nec et</quote>, 5.65 <quote>tinniat
                     ore</quote>. Finally, in the same Codex Riccardianus there are certain
                  corrections that cannot be attributed to Angeli, but doubtlessly descend from some
                  manuscript of the first family. Perhaps some corrector copied those, too, from the
                  Codex Germanicus.</p>
               <p>Regarding Boccaccio's manuscript, truly the things that can be said are few and
                  uncertain. For although the Codex Harleianus, according to its subscription, was
                  collated with the Codex Germanicus, Boccaccio's manuscript, and many others, for
                  the most part the readings that Angelius did not note in the Codex Riccardianus
                  seem to go back to Boccaccio's manuscript. AFter carefully inspecting these
                  readings, we can conclude only this: that manuscrupt that Boccaccio is said to
                  have written with his own hand, must be assigned to the so-called first family.
                  Everything else is highly uncertain. As for the authority of this manuscript, the
                  same things apply that I said about the Codex Germanicus. Finally, I think we
                  should not overlook that in one place (N. 4.70 <quote>quo</quote> Boccaccio's
                  manuscript alone, out of all of the manuscripts, displays the true reading.</p>

                  <p>Now I must discuss the excerpts. Two manuscripts in Paris, namely Thuaneus

                     have also some verses selected from Calpurnius' eclogues 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and a
                     few others from Nemesianus' fourth eclogue, attributed there to Calpurnius. For
                     in the Codex Thuaneus at the beginning of the first excerpt the following is
                     inscribed: <quote>Calpurnius in bucolicis</quote>; in the Codex Nostradamensis:
                        <quote>Scalpurius in bucolicis</quote>. But in the latter, the corruption of
                     the name traces its origin to the initial letter of the first verse:
                        <quote>Satis hoc</quote> (2.23). These are the fragments: Calp. 2.23
                        <quote>satis</quote>-24, 3.10 <quote>mobilior-femina</quote>, 4.14–15, 4.155

                     <quote>vocat-umbram</quote>. Nearly the same verses are found in a certain
                     codex in Berlin (ms. Diez. B. Santen. 60 fol. 29ʳ): cfr. <ref target="#Haupt"

                     1880. In 1909, I was the first to collate the excerpta Bononiensia.</p>
                  <p>Now let us discuss the worth of the excerpts. Certainly the excerpta
                     Bononiensia were copied from some manuscript of the second family. Compare
                     these passages: Nemes. 4.21 <quote>eris–flores</quote> V Exc. Bon.,
                        <quote>(h)erit
                        florem<!-- Again, what to do about these parentheses? --></quote> N G, 4.24

                        et</quote> V Exc. Bon., <quote>volucru et</quote> N, <quote>volucrum
                        tum</quote> G, 4.30 <quote>perdis</quote> V Exc. Bon., <quote>prodis</quote>
                     N G, 4.58 <quote>animos</quote> V Exc. Bon., <quote>annos</quote> N G. But the
                     books in Paris have a better reputation by far. In the following places N G
                     Exc. Par. offer a good reading, but V offers a bad one: Calp 4.14
                        <quote>nunc</quote> N G Exc. Par., <quote>dum</quote> V, 4.155
                        <quote>contingat</quote> N G Exc. Par., <quote>contigerit</quote> V, 4.156
                        <quote>dicit</quote> N G Exc. Par., <quote>dixit</quote> V, Nemes. 4.24
                        <quote>quod</quote> N G Exc. Par., <quote>tibi</quote> V. Add these, too:
                     Nemes. 4.24 <quote>commodet</quote> G Exc. Par., <quote>comodet</quote> N,
                        <quote>commodat</quote> V. But in two places V Exc. Par. preserve an
                     attested reading that N G have corrupted: Calp. 2.23 <quote>hoc</quote> V Exc.
                     Par., <quote>hic</quote> N G, Nemes. 4.21 <quote>eris-flores</quote> V Exc.
                     Par., <quote>(h)erit-florem</quote> N G. Moreover, in only one place have the
                     excerpta Parisina admitted the interpolations of the inferior manuscripts:
                     Calp. 5.12 <quote>iamdudum</quote> pler. V Exc. Par., <quote>aetas iam</quote>
                     N G. At Calp. 6.55 N and G and the excerpts are different. Finally, they
                     present some readings unique to them: Calp. 4.15 <quote>valeate</quote> Par.
                     pr., 155 <quote>michi</quote>, 5.45 <quote>erit; dubitanda</quote> Par. post.
                     5.48 <quote>tonsoribus</quote> Par. pr., 6.54 <quote>torvata</quote> Par. pr.
                     We have already said that all of the manuscripts that we have today must be
                     traced back by various paths to the same archetype, as their many errors in
                     common indicate, especially the lacuna and the confusion of verses in the
                     amoebaean song in Calpurnius' fourth eclogue. But that the excerpts about which
                     we speak cannot trace their origin further is supported by a single, but very
                     strong argument (cf. <bibl><author>H. Schenkl</author>, <title level="j">Wiener
                           Studien</title>

                        /></bibl>). For at Calp. 4.156, where Heinsius quite successfully restored
                        <quote>ovilia</quote>, all of the manuscripts and the excerpts have
                        <quote>vilia</quote></p>
                  <p>Before I end this preface, I want to offer my thanks to those who deserve it
                     from me. H. Cocchia, A. E. Housan, F. Leo, F. Ramorino, G. C. Summers, most
                     learned and humane men, to whom I owe my greatest thanks, kindly pointed out
                     many things while I was establishing the text of Calpurnius and Nemesianus. But
                     so that no one attributes to them the errors that I have met with, I declare
                     that I have noted all that they shared with me in the appratus criticus, each
                     in its own place<!-- not happy with that last bit -->.</p>
