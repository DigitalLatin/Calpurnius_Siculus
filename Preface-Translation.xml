               <p>The seven eclogues of Calpurnius and the four of Nemesianus are preserved in the
                  same manuscripts, which is how it comes to pass that they are always published
                  together by scholars, even though they differ in terms of refinement and charm.
                  Add to this the fact that many who use inferior manuscripts that attribute the
                  eleven eclogues to Calpurnius alone say that Nemesianus did not write any eclogues
                  at all. From the time of [Taddeo] Ugoleto there has been no shortage of those who
                  divide the poems between Calpurnius and Nemesianus, assigning the last four to the
                  latter; until recently they thought that Calpurnius had sent his poems to
                  Nemesianus. But <bibl><author>Moriz Haupt</author> (<title xml:lang="la"><hi

                  Nemesianus. He also demonstrated that Calpurnius lived under the reign of Nero,
                  while Nemesianus lived in the time of Carus and his sons. Haupt's opinion, which

                  Nevertheless, both because of the similarity in subject matter and the fact that
                  the condition of the text is the same in both poets' eclogues, I prefer to place
                  Calpurnius side-by-side with Nemesianus.</p>

               <head>II. Overview of the Tradition</head>
               <p>There are three closely related families of manuscripts of Calpurnius and
                  Nemesianus, in particular all of those that trace their origin back to three books
                  copied from the same archetype. The first family includes two manuscripts that
                  should be considered the best witnesses of all, since they are nearly free of
                  interpolations, even though they rather frequently show blemishes from the
                  ignorance and carelessness of their copyists. Many manuscripts conform to the
                  so-called family <ref target="#V">V</ref>. Their extraordinary agreement in many
                  errors demonstrates that all of them emanate from one book, which is also clear
                  enough from the sheer abundance of interpolations that are unique to this family.
                  And yet, these manuscripts are not corrupted in the same manner, but they can be
                  divided into distinct groups, which seems to me a tedious business and hardly
                  worthwhile. Besides, <bibl><author>Schenkl</author> (<title level="j">Wiener
                        Studien</title>

                     <date>1883</date></bibl> and on page 50ff. of the preface to his first edition)
                  has distinguished two families, <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                     >w</hi>, but I wish he had not. It is easy for me to agree with that most
                  learned man concerning the group that is called <hi rend="italic">w</hi>; but with
                  regard to the manuscripts that he denotes with the letter <hi rend="italic"
                  >v</hi>, it is impossible to know that all of them are of the same kind when only
                  a few readings have received full scrutiny. But one manuscript is assigned to the
                  third family because it presents very many errors that the other manuscripts lack
                  entirely. Moreover, a good number of readings are found in it that are
                  characteristic of the better manuscripts, but it has none in common with the
                  inferior manuscripts. For this reason it occupies a kind of middle ground, so to
                  speak, between the books of good repute and those that have been corrupted.
                  Indeed, readings have been selected for these books from the German manuscript of
                  Thadeus Ugoletus and from the manuscript belonging to Boccaccio, and various
                  excerpts should be added, too. I will consider these matters below.</p>

               <p>Now I must discuss the manuscripts of the first family: <ref target="#N">N =

                  Neapolitanus V a 8, formerly 380, parchment, 261 X 160 mm., was written at about
                  the beginning of the fifteenth century. It consists of 116 leaves, of which 1–36ʳ
                  contain Cato's <hi rend="italic">De Agricultura</hi>; 20–101ʳ, Varro's <hi

                     >Bucolica</hi> of Calpurnius and Nemesianus. The remaining leaves are blank.
                  Each page has thirty-eight verses. With respect to correcting hands, the
                  manuscript puts two in particular to the test. The first belongs to the original
                  copyist. The manuscript was corrected again around the same time, but here and
                  there the second hand cannot easily be distinguished from the first. A third
                  hand's emendations can be discerned in only a few places. The individual poems
                  lack titles, but they are separated from each other by brief spaces. The following
                  subscription appears at the end of the whole work: <quote xml:lang="la">Aureliani
                     Nemesiani Cartag&#773; bucol&#8217; explicit: Deo gratias amen</quote>.
                  Finally, another more recent hand, as Bursian and Schenkl recognized, wrote <quote
                     xml:lang="la">Calpurnii eclogae</quote> and <quote xml:lang="la">Nemesiani
                     eclogae</quote>.</p>
               <p>We know nothing about the origin and provenance of this manuscript except what is
                  understood from the following passages written on the last leaf: <quote

                  ("Joannes Antonius Perillus, a nobleman of Naples and most learned gentleman, gave
                  this book to Jacob Perillus in 1667 on the first of June"), and a little below,

                  from his best friend Jacob Perillus"). Later it was brought to the library of San
                  Giovanni a Carbonara, and from there it came to the greatest library in Naples,
                  formerly known as the <orgName xml:id="preface-borbonica">Reale biblioteca

                  this manuscript carefully enough for Pieter Burmann's use; his collation appears
                  in the <ref

                  examined it on behalf of Moriz Haupt, but nothing is known about the quality of
                  his collation, since the edition promised by Haupt was never published. <ref
                     target="#Baehr.">Baehrens</ref> was the next to use it, but in way that rightly
                  earned the scorn of Schenkl, who collated the manuscript in 1878 and inspected it
                  again a few years later when preparing his <ref target="#Schenkl2">second edition
                     of Calpurnius and Nemesianus</ref>. For my part, I examined the entire
                  manuscript in 1907, but to remove all of the discrepancies between my collation
                  and the testimony of Schenkl, in the summer of 1909 my friend Giampietro Zottoli
                  inspected with me all of the places where Schenkl had a different reading, and we
                  often uncovered carelessness on Schenkl's part. I have published in my apparatus
                  criticus the entire collation of his manuscript, omitting not even the slightest
                  thing to do with orthography.</p>
               <p xml:id="CodexGaddianusTrans"><ref target="#G" rend="bold">G</ref> = Codex
                  Gaddianus Laurentianus plut. 90, 12 inf., paper, 294 X 225 mm., written at the
                  beginning of the fifteenth century, consists of 74 leaves. It contains the twelve
                  eclogues of Francesco Petrarch (ff. 1–44), the <bibl><title>Culex</title></bibl>
                  of Vergilius Maro, the <bibl><title>Dirae</title></bibl> of Vergilius Maro (ff.
                  52–55), and Calpurnius and Nemesianus (ff. 55–74). A very brief, unattributed
                  eclogue follows with the interlocutors Daphnis, Tityrus, Mopsus, and Meliboeus.
                  Individual pages generally have twenty-nine verses, but some vary, with the
                  shorter ones having twenty-six and the longer ones haveing thirty-two verses. The
                  following inscription has been added to the eclogues of Calpurnius: <quote
                     xml:lang="la">Egloge Calfurnii ad nemesianum cartaginiensem.</quote>
                     (<quote>The Eclogues of Calfurnius to Nemesianus of Carthage</quote>).
                  Nemesianus follows Calpurnius with the following title prefixed: <quote
                     xml:lang="la">Aureliani nemesiani cartaginiensis egloghe incipiunt</quote>
                     (<quote>Here begin the eclogues of Aurelianus Nemesianus of Carthage</quote>).
                  At the end of each eclogue there appears an <hi rend="italic">explicit</hi> with
                  the number of each eclogue, but Calpunrius' sixth eclogue lacks a subscription,
                  and the following is written at the end of the seventh: <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >explicit sexta egloga Calphurnii</quote> (<quote>Here ends the sixth eclogue
                     of Calphurnius</quote>). This is explained by the fact that the seventh eclogue
                  follows the sixth without any break, with the result that only six eclogues are
                  attributed to Calpurnius in this manuscript. But in the margin, where the sixth
                  eclogue ought to end, the copyist has added the following: <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >aliqui volunt dicere quod ista sit alia et diversa egloga ubi incipit ≪ lentus
                     ≫, aliqui dicunt quod est una etc.</quote> (<quote>Some wish to say that the
                     eclogue that begins <hi rend="italic">lentus</hi> is a completely different
                     eclogue; others say that it is the same, etc.</quote>)</p>
               <p>In this manuscript the copyist himself added almost all of the corrections either
                  by removing scribal errors in the verses or adding variant readings to the margin.
                  But there are some that seem to have been made by another hand. The manuscript was
                  mentioned by <ref target="#Glaeser">Glaeser</ref> and <ref target="#Haupt"
                     >Haupt</ref>, but <ref target="#Baehr.">Baehrens</ref> was the first to examine
                  it, far too hurriedly; <ref target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref> was the next to use
                  it, much more carefully. I myself transcribed the manuscript in 1908 with as much
                  attentiveness as I could, but I collated it again in the following year, to settle
                  all of the discrepancies with <ref target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref>. Still, there
                  are very many places that <ref target="Schenkl">Schenkl</ref> has reported
                  erroneously, as you can gather from my notes, for I have taken greatest pains to
                  publish all of the readings of this manuscript, too.</p>
               <p>Having described the outer appearance of manuscripts N and G and explained their
                  provenance, I must now discuss in more detail their relationship and their
                  importance. Until now, no one except <ref target="#Baehr.">Baehrens</ref> and <ref
                     target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref> has examined the authority of either
                  manuscript. It is no wonder, since <ref target="#Baehr.">Baehrens</ref> was the
                  first to collate the Gaddianus, and no one before <ref target="#Glaeser"
                     >Glaeser</ref> considered the Neapolitanus of much value. But <ref
                     target="#Baehr.">Baehrens</ref> and <ref target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref> held
                  different opinions: the former, as usual, overvalues a manuscript that he was the
                  first to publish and argues that the Gaddianus is superior to the others; the
                  latter, however, prefers the Neapolitanus. But <ref target="#Baehr."
                     >Baehrens</ref> asserts his point of view instead of demonstrating it with
                  strong evidence. On the other hand, <ref target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref> tried to
                  demonstrate that the Gaddianus admitted interpolations in some places. It seems to
                  me that neither one has hit upon the truth entirely, as I think the following
                  makes clear.</p>
               <p>I have already said that both manuscripts descend from the same archetype, and
                  that is supported by the very large number of readings that N has in common with
                  G, when something else is written in the rest of the manuscripts. But, to be fair,
                  they differ among themselves in many places, and it is right to discuss their
                  differences so that it will be easier to see which manuscript departs less from
                  the archetype. In doing this, I take no account of readings that are attributed to
                  the second or third hand in the Neapolitanus or of the various readings that the
                  copyist added in the margin of the Gaddianus. I shall consider those later.</p>
               <p>But first of all, although the repute of each of the two manuscripts is frequently
                  distorted because of the carelessness and ignorance of the copyists, it seems to
                  me that the Gaddianus was copied a little more carelessly. For instance, four
                  verses (Calp. 1.40, 4.16, 4.123; Nemes. 1.73) are missing from it, and Nemesianus
                  2.49 has been placed after verse 45: Moreover, the following words have been
                  omitted: Calp. 1.92 <quote xml:lang="la">ipsa</quote>, 2.88 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >quotiens</quote>, 3.23 <quote xml:lang="la">deus</quote>, 3.3 <quote
                     xml:lang="la">sed</quote>, 3.89 <quote xml:lang="la">non</quote>. But in the
                  Neapolitan manuscript, no verse is missing (it is unnecessary, I think, for me to
                  remind you that I speak here about the unique defects of each manuscript, not
                  about the common defects that are rightly assigned to the archetype), but Calp.
                  1.31–32 have been inverted, and Nemes. 2.81 was inserted after 3.16. Then the
                  copyist overlooked the following words: Calp. 6.46 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >pignus</quote>, 6.90 <quote xml:lang="la">hoc</quote>, Nemes. 1.23 <quote
                     xml:lang="la">et</quote>, 1.71 <quote xml:lang="la">et</quote>, 3.5 <quote
                     xml:lang="la">ex tereti</quote>, 4.60 <quote xml:lang="la">audit</quote>. Add
                  to this the fact that in almost 130 places N offers the correct reading and G an
                  erroneous one and the opposite happens a little less frequently.</p>
               <p>Each of the two manuscripts has some errors (N has more by far) in common with V,
                  which could not have happened in every case entirely by chance. The following
                  places are clearly due to interpolation: Calp. 2.73 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >cicius</quote> or <quote xml:lang="la">citius tenues</quote> NV, 3.35 <quote
                     xml:lang="la">quod</quote> NV, 6.25 <quote xml:lang="la">verba</quote> N,
                     <quote xml:lang="la">verba</quote> and <quote xml:lang="la">verbo</quote> V,
                  6.82 <quote xml:lang="la">te stante</quote> NV, 7.33 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >tibi</quote> GV, Nemes. 3.37 <quote xml:lang="la">ostendit</quote>. The rest
                  of the examples are either doubtful or should be disregarded entirely.</p>
               <p>Next, some have deemed the following places in G as possibly
                  suspicious:<!-- Maybe do this as a list? --> Calp. 1.12 <quote xml:lang="la"

                     <quote xml:lang="la">enim</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la">pascua</quote>, <quote
                     xml:lang="la">mascillo</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la">in</quote>, <quote
                     xml:lang="la">canis</quote> are without doubt glosses inserted later in place
                  of the poets' words. One could say the same thing about <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >accipiet</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la">ethera</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >discedere</quote>. Also <quote xml:lang="la">aethera</quote> and <quote
                     xml:lang="la">discedere</quote> are just as good as <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >aera</quote> and <quote xml:lang="la">descendere</quote>, and for a long time
                  I was not sure which of the two I preferred. And <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >liquide</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la">primum</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >flavit</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la">carmina</quote> (Nemes. I 16) should not
                  be considered interpolations, but rather corruptions that arose in these places
                  since the words that should have been written by the copyist appeared nearby.
                  Thus, <quote xml:lang="la">liquide</quote> is derived from <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >dulce</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la">primum</quote> from <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >spatium</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la">flavit</quote> from <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >inflare</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la">carmina</quote> from <quote
                     xml:lang="la">carmine</quote>. But <quote xml:lang="la">carmina</quote> (Nemes.
                  1.63) is either a gloss or a corruption that owes its origin from the initial
                  sound of the next word, and <quote xml:lang="la">corpore</quote> and <quote
                     xml:lang="la">robore</quote> are very often confused in the manuscripts. Then
                  there are these words: <quote xml:lang="la">herus</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >raris</quote>, <quote xml:lang="la">omnes</quote>. One would hardly believe
                  that they were made by an interpolator since they are meaningless. But for the
                  most part, the rest of the examples can be attributed to an interpolator. The
                  following places in N should be considered: Calp. 1.13 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >sequar</quote>, 4.46 <quote xml:lang="la">inter nostras</quote>, 4.136 <quote
                     xml:lang="la">pede velox</quote>, 4.153 <quote xml:lang="la">in</quote>, 4.164
                     <quote xml:lang="la">vestros</quote>, Nemes. 2.71 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >ducas</quote>. <quote xml:lang="la">in</quote> is a gloss. <quote
                     xml:lang="la">ducas</quote> is closer to <quote xml:lang="la">ducam</quote>,
                  which the inferior manuscripts have, than to <quote xml:lang="la">duco</quote>,
                  which G correctly offers. <quote xml:lang="la">vestros</quote> is owed to an
                  interpolator. The rest are uncertain.</p>
               <p>Finally, the writings of both manuscripts have been corrupted in various ways, but
                  sometimes they betray an infelicitous effort at emendation. I would like you to
                  consider the following places, for it is not necessary to say anything about the
                  rest): Calp. 1.90 <quote xml:lang="la">querit</quote> N, <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >petit</quote> G; 2.96 <quote xml:lang="la">o</quote> G; 3.50 <quote
                     xml:lang="la">turbidus</quote> G; 4.63 <quote xml:lang="la">carmen
                     modulavit</quote> G; 4.125 <quote xml:lang="la">placanda</quote> G; 5.15 <quote
                     xml:lang="la">montibus</quote> G; 5.16 <quote xml:lang="la">cecinere</quote> G;
                  5.104 <quote xml:lang="la">nectendum</quote> N, <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >videndum</quote> G; Nemes. 2.30 <quote xml:lang="la">nullo sudarunt</quote> G,
                  4.28 <quote xml:lang="la">volucrum tum</quote> G; 4.39 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >subeunte</quote> G. Indeed it is hardly the case that all of these places are
                  equally suspicious, for <quote xml:lang="la">o</quote> is a gloss, and I do not
                  think one should think otherwise about <quote xml:lang="la">carmen
                     modulavit</quote>. But <quote xml:lang="la">turbidus</quote> is clearly an
                  interpolation, which I could hardly say about <quote xml:lang="la">volucrum
                     tum</quote>. Then <quote xml:lang="la">querit</quote> and <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >petit</quote> perhaps stem from a poorly understood abbreviation of the word
                     <quote xml:lang="la">quatit</quote>, but that gives me pause. But the other
                  examples, with due respect to <ref target="#Schenkl">Schenkl</ref>, are hardly
                  attributable to interpolators, unless you happen to think that those interpolators
                  were completely ignorant of the Latin language.</p>
               <p>But before we pass judgment on the authority of manuscripts N and G, we must say a
                  few things about the corrections that each manuscript underwent.</p>
               <p xml:id="Ndesc-firsthand">Manuscript N, <ref target="#CodexNeapolitanusTrans">as we said above</ref>, was
                  emended rather often by the original copyist and others. But all of the
                  emendations of the first hand, which I have detected in almost sixty places, arose
                  from the archetype itself. The copyist, as often happens, sometimes corrected the
                  more trivial scribal errors as he wrote; we are all used to making these errors
                  when we write. Accordingly, he added letters that he omitted by writing too
                  quickly, or he deleted extra letters, or he changed vowels and consonants, or he
                  added words that had been omitted, or he restored the order of verses, or he
                  inserted notes about people. Since that is the case, nearly all of the emendations
                  by the first hand are good, or, to state it more truthfully, they restore the
                  wording of the archetype. At Calp. 1.20, the first hand corrected <quote
                     xml:lang="la">dipicta</quote> to <quote xml:lang="la">depicta</quote>, which
                     <ref target="#Jacoby">Jacoby</ref> recently defended in vain, since <quote
                     xml:lang="la">descripta</quote> is to be read without doubt (cfr. Verg. Ecl.
                  5.13 and Calp. 1.25), but <quote xml:lang="la">depicta</quote> was in the
                  archetype, as G shows us. Similarly at Nemes. 4.65 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >aversa</quote> is wrong (cfr. Verg. Ecl. 8.101 sq.), and the first hand has
                  changed the fault into <quote xml:lang="la">adversa</quote>, but <quote
                     xml:lang="la">adversa</quote> is found in G, from which you can easily conclude
                  that the same reading appeared in the archetype. Only once did the first hand
                  corrupt the true reading of the archetype (Calp. 3.67 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >qui</quote> from <quote xml:lang="la">quam</quote>), but that should be
                  attributed to an abbreviation, not at all to his intellect. Finally, all of the
                  corrections of the first hand are confirmed by the readings in manuscript G, with
                  the exception of Calp. 1.24 <quote xml:lang="la">propius</quote>, where I have
                  reasonable suspicion that the person who wrote G misread the word.</p>
               <p xml:id="Ndesc-secondhand">The second hand's so-called emendations are three times as frequent as the first
                  hand's, but in terms of proportion, they are found much more often in Calpurnius
                  than in Nemesianus, and around a third of them are correct. For the most part, the
                  second hand corrects scribal errors of a more trivial sort, but sometimes it
                  restores omitted verses or errors, or it corrects transposed verses, or it
                  completely overhauls more serious problems. In general, the second hand's
                  emendations come from manuscripts of the second family, not the archetype, but an
                  interpolator has corrected some of them after his own fashion. It does not take
                  many examples to demonstrate this, but, to begin with passages successfully
                  restored, consider these readings with me, dear reader:</p>

               <p>And so if the second hand's emendations agree with manuscripts of family V, they
                  can add no authority to them, since they arose from them; but if they depend on no
                  other manuscript, they must be considered to be the conjectures of a fairly
                  learned person. If we have discussed them correctly, the emendations of that sort
                  are entirely without merit, and I did not unjustly omit them outright when I
                  compared manuscript N with G.</p>
               <p xml:id="Ndesc-thirdhand">Finally, there are five emendations by the third hand, of which three are good
                  (Calp. 2.1 <quote xml:lang="la">puer</quote>, 2.4 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >gravis</quote>, 2.33 <quote xml:lang="la">pomona</quote>) and two are bad
                  (Calp. 1.59 <quote xml:lang="la">truderit</quote>, 5.11 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >ganā</quote>).</p>
               <p>Manuscript G offers more than eighty emendations in its own right. With two or
                  three exceptions where you can recognize another hand, they are the work of the
                  original copyist. Sometimes he restored verses or words that had been omitted, but
                  for the most part he corrected the more trivial scribal errors. All of the
                  corrections are good, and they are derived from the archetype itself (as agreement
                  with its twin manuscript shows), with only three exceptions: Nemes. 2.73, 3.63,
                  4.10, which the scribe unsucessfully tried to emend. Nemes. 3.53 does not count,
                  since in this passage either the copyist of manuscript N could read poorly, or G
                  entered a correction made either above the line or in the margin of the archetype.
                  But aside from these emendations I found nearly alternate readings in the margin
                  of this manuscript, which most often were added by the copyist himself. All are
                  derived either from some manuscript of no special repute or from the conjecture of
                  some scholar. For the most part, they are not even worthy of mention.</p>
               <p>If I have done my job, it is clear what we should think about each of these
                  manuscripts. Manuscripts N and G outstrip the others not only in the good quality
                  of their archetype, but also because their copyists were content to transcribe the
                  archetype faithfully, and they generally abstained from interpolating the words of
                  the poets. For very rarely have the words handed down from antiquity been
                  corrupted by the judgment of the scribes. That is why this is the biggest
                  difference between the Neapolitanus and the Gaddianus: that the latter generally
                  put the reading of the archetype to the test by his own devices, but the former
                  admitted the interpolations of inferior manuscripts. And, if we want to think
                  clearly, the Neapolitanus should be preferred in a certain way, but not as Schenkl
                  wanted. For the Gaddianus has nearly the same number of good readings as the
                  Neapolitanus, and sometimes it alone out of all of the manuscripts preserves the
                  genuine reading for us. And so, there is need for both manuscripts in representing
                  the true picture of the archetype.</p>

                     has meticulously described the outer appearance of this manuscript. The eleven
                     eclogues of Calpurnius are contained on leaves 95ʳ–113ᵛ of this manuscript,

                     the mistake. Now I shall return to what I started. The eleven eclogues of
                     Calpurnius are contained in this manuscript (ff. 25–45), along with other minor
                     works of various authors that are not worth mentioning here, since the poems of
                     Calpurnius, as Schenkl knew, were formerly separated from the rest. And
                     Calpurnius' bucolic poetry includes such a large number of corrections and
                     glosses added by various hands either in the verses themselves or in the margin
                     that the various hands cannot always be distinguished among themselves. But
                     that is as much as I will say, since I propose to discuss the annotations of

                  following to say about the codices Rehdigerani: <quote>The second codex
                     Rehdigeranus (that is, I.4.11), retrieved from the Rehdigeran library in this
                     city (i.e., Wrocław), quarto, written carelessly in the fifteenth century, 115
                     leaves. All eleven are ascribed to Calpurnius. They are preserved on leaves
                     3ʳ–22ʳ. Aside from one inscription at the beginning, no other is found in this
                     book, and no indication of characters, with the exception of the recto of the
                     third leaf. Here, the copyist put this sign (") in the margin when the
                     character changes. Individual pages have twenty-six verses. Although this
                     manuscript contains many erroneous readings, I can assert that good readings
                     are not entirely missing from it. I have collated it myself." "I received
                     permission to use the first codex Rehdigeranus (that is, I.4.10) from the
                     Rehdigeran library that is in this city. It is a quarto volume of mixed
                     material (paper and parchment), beautifully written in the fifteenth century.
                     It consists of 130 leaves. It contains all eleven eclogues assigned to
                     Calpurnius. They appear on leave 3ʳ–27ʳ. Titles and signs for characters are
                     decorated with red ink. Each page has twenty-two or twenty-three verses.
                     Additionally, many of the minor poems of Vergil and other others (some more
                     recent) are written in it. I collated it myself."</quote></p>
               <p>All of the manuscripts that I have assigned to the second family were copied from
                  one book, which I will call <ref target="#V">V</ref>, or from a copy of it. The
                  common origin of these manuscripts is attested not only by the omission or
                  transposition of the same verses and words, but also by the great number of
                  interpolations and errors that the other manuscripts lack entirely. But aside from
                  these common faults, which were transmitted from the archetype, the individual
                  manuscripts have many other errors unique to themselves. These books can be
                  assigned to specific groups through careful comparison. For that reason, I do not
                  want to linger on this subject, but I will advise that Riccadianus 724 and
                  Vaticanus Reginensis 1759 are so similar to each other that you would rightly come
                  to the following conclusions: that they were copied from the same book; that the
                  Ottobonianus, Laurentianus pl. 37,14, the first Rehdigeranus (I.4.10), the
                  Gothanus, and the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> descended from the same
                  copy of manuscript <ref target="#V">V</ref> on account of certain evidence; and
                  finally that Vaticanus Urbinas 353 and the <hi rend="italic">editio Veneta</hi> in
                  1472 are closely related by the tightest bonds of affinity. For the oldest
                  editions are rightly thought to be reproductions of manuscripts (cfr. <ref
                     target="#Sabbadini">Sabbadini</ref>, p. 213 n. 5); moreover, the <hi
                     rend="italic">editio Veneta</hi> was printed before Fridericus de Veteranis
                  transcribed the Codex Urbinas (cfr. <ref target="#Curcio">Curcio</ref>, p. VIII).
                  Finally, I add that I found the oldest edition of Calpurnius and Nemesianus in the
                  Bibliotheca Riccardiana, recorded by no editor until now, place and year of
                  publication unknown, currently bearing the number 498, which I can demonstrate by
                  the strongest of arguments was copied from the manuscript Laurentianus pl. 37,14
                  before that manuscript underwent the corrections of the so-called second hand.</p>
               <p>If any one should collate all of the manuscripts of this family with care, he
                  would easily know which readings are those of the archetype from which all of them
                  originate, and which are owed to the copyists of the individual manuscripts. And
                  so now it remains to compare <ref target="#V">V</ref> with <ref target="#N"
                     >N</ref> and <ref target="#G">G</ref> and to see what authority should be
                  attributed to them.</p>
               <p>First of all, both families, but more often <ref target="#V">V</ref>, are marred
                  with gaps in verses and words. Eleven verses are missing in <ref target="#V"
                     >V</ref> (Calp. 1.51, 7.32–34, 7.52–54, Nemes. 1.29, 2.83, 3.25, 3.30) and one
                  verse has been made from the two verses Calp. 2.18–19. On the other hand, Calp.
                  1.42 is missing in <ref target="#N">N</ref> and <ref target="#G">G</ref>, and the
                  following words have been omitted: Calp. 4.94 <quote xml:lang="la">posito</quote>,
                  7.71 <quote xml:lang="la">et</quote>, Nemes. 3.6 <quote xml:lang="la">hanc pueri
                     tamquam</quote>. Moreover, in <ref target="#N">N</ref>
                  <ref target="G">G</ref> Calpurnius 5.7 is placed before 5.6 and in <ref
                     target="#V">V</ref> Calpurnius 5.67 is placed before 5.66. But since verses and
                  supplied words have been passed down from antiquity and cannot be attributed to
                  interpolators, the carelessness of copyists must not be blamed in these passages.
                  But with regard to the words <quote xml:lang="la">(h)anc pueri tamquam</quote>,
                  which were omitted in <ref target="#N">N</ref>
                  <ref target="#G">G</ref> even though there was space for them, the copyist, in my
                  opinion, deliberately omitted them because he did not understand the writing in
                  the archetype.</p>
               <p><ref target="#N">N</ref>
                  <ref target="#G">G</ref> and <ref target="#V">V</ref> differ in two hundred places
                  or even more, but the readings correctly preserved in <ref target="#N">N</ref>

                  family. Moreover, what is even more interesting, nearly all of the corruptions
                  that blemish <ref target="#N">N</ref>
                  <ref target="#G">G</ref> are owed to the carelessness or ignorance of their
                  copyists, but <ref target="#V">V</ref> quite often underwent interpolations. For
                  example, there is no doubt that in <ref target="#N">N</ref>
                  <ref target="#G">G</ref> the following passages drew their flaws from either the
                  carelessness of a copyist or an abbreviation poorly understood: Calp. 1.28 <quote

               <p>Glosses have been received into the text in the following passages: Calp. 1.5
                     <quote xml:lang="la">molliter</quote>, Nemes. 1.49 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >mortali</quote>, 2.42 <quote xml:lang="la">vini</quote>, 1.51 <quote
                     xml:lang="la">uvas</quote>. Also, <quote xml:lang="la">litora</quote> Nem. 2.22
                  comes from the same word placed at the beginning of the verse, and <quote
                     xml:lang="la">visus</quote> Calp. 7.84 comes from the preceding verse. There
                  are certainly some passages that you could trace back to an interpolator: Calp.

                  from the perspective of the archetype, I would attribute even these passages, with
                  one or two exceptions, to the ignorance or carelessness of a copyist.</p>
               <p>The same cannot be said about the archetype of the second family; indeed, things
                  could not be more different. To say nothing of glosses received into the text, or
                  words moved either because of the scribes' mistake or judgment (cfr. Calp. 1.8–9,
                  2.4, 2.73, 3.74, 3.88, 4.76, 4.83, 7.83, Nemes. 1.72, 2.1, 2.23, 2.33, 2.40, 2.47,
                  2.76, 4.54), and other faults that you could explain in various ways, I have
                  detected the following in particular in it, and it detracts greatly from its
                  authority. I refer to a great abundance of interpolations that have arisen only
                  out of a passion for making changes. And, just to dismiss the several passages
                  that others have ascribed to the carelessness of copyists, there is no reason to
                  doubt that the readings marshalled here are owed to an interpolator: Calp. 1.45

               <p>The copyist who wrote the Codex Parisinus was utterly ignorant of the Latin
                  language. In his completely careless performance of his task he committed
                  countless scribal errors, and he did not finish his work, since the manuscript
                  contains the first three eclogues by Calpurnius and stops in mid-sentence at verse
                  12 of the fourth. Since I have mentioned all of the readings of this manuscript in
                  my apparatus criticus, there is no need to report here all of the defects of
                  writing with which it teems. But I will now recount certain rather curious things
                  that are unique to this manuscript, so that you will be all the more amazed at the
                  copyist's carelessness and ignorance:</p>

               <p>But despite such an abundance of errors, sometimes the Codex Parisinus reports a
                  correct reading of the archetype that has been corrupted in the other two
                  families: cfr. 2.14 <quote xml:lang="la">naides</quote> P, <quote xml:lang="la"

                  passages could have been emended by conjecture, nevertheless you would hardly
                  think that a copyist whose ignorance and carelessness we have detected in so many
                  and such great passages should be pardoned. If we have discussed these matters
                  properly, all of the interpolations that the manuscript underwent are owed to the
                  archetype, but the numerous mistakes in writing must be attributed to the
                  copyist.</p>
               <p>But to make a better judgment about the worth of this manuscript, we should
                  consider what its readings are in the passages where the first family differs from
                  the second.</p>
               <p>First of all, N G P often give a good reading where V has a corrupt one:</p>

               <p>In conclusion, to review what has been accomplished in this discussion, where N
                  and G agree with P, there is no doubt that their reading should be preferred to
                  readings of the second family. We have seen that this rule is violated in only
                  three places (1.48 <quote xml:lang="la">victas</quote>, 2.14 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >affuerant</quote>, 3.73 <quote xml:lang="la">vi</quote>), with which I do not
                  concern myself. But where N and G differ from P and V, both groups of manuscripts
                  have nearly the same number of good and corrupt readings. But far be it from me to
                  give equal authority to both groups, for nearly all of the corruptions that N and
                  G received, as it were, by inheritance from the archetype of the first family are
                  owed to the carelessness or ignorance of copyists, but the faults of other
                  manuscripts should be attributed to the perverse zeal of pseudo-scholars for
                  emending and interpolating. That is why, with one or two exceptions, there is
                  never any uncertainty about which reading to select. If these matters have been
                  established correctly, then the Codex Parisinus cannot always be accepted as an
                  arbiter, but we ought always to consider its readings and we must also be sad that
                  it has such a brief run of verses.</p>

               <head>VI. Two lost manuscripts</head>
               <p>Now let us discuss the two manuscripts that are lost to us today, that is the
                  Taddeo Ugoleto's Codex Germanicus (= <ref target="#A" rend="bold">A</ref>) and
                  Boccaccio's manuscript (= <ref target="#H" rend="bold">H</ref>).</p>
               <p xml:id="AngeliTrans">We know nothing about the Codex Germanicus other than what
                  Niccolò Angeli has handed down to us about it. Also, the following is written in
                  Codex Riccardianus 636 at the end of Calpurnius in the hand of Angeli: <quote
                     xml:id="Riccardianus636SubTrans">From a very ancient manuscript brought from
                     Germany | this title has been copied: The end of the bucolics of | Calpurnius,
                     the first eclogue of Aurelius Nemesianus the poet | from Carthage</quote>.
                  Then, at the end of Nemesianus: <quote>I, Niccolò Angeli, collated this manuscript
                     against many others and the very old manuscript that Taddeo Ugoleto, librarian
                     of the royal library in Hungary, brought with him from Germany and prepared for
                     my use. Many poems were discovered in it. In the year of salvation
                  1492</quote>. Regarding Boccaccio's manuscript, Codex Harleianus 2578 (about which
                  see <bibl><author>C. Schenkl</author> in the preface to his edition of Ausonius
                     [Berlin 1884], p. XXI)</bibl> offers similar testimony. At the end of
                  Nemesianus, the following subscription is found: <quote>This manuscript was
                     collated with greatest care with the very old manuscript that Taddeo Ugoleto,
                     librarian of the royal library in Hungary, brought from Germany. Also with the
                     one that Giovanni Boccaccio is said to have written with his own hand to
                     dedicate to the library of Santo Spirito in Florence: We found the title and
                     division of the work in that manuscript, along with many poems.</quote></p>
               <p>Codex Riccardianus 636 is written very beautifully on the leaves that contain the
                  bucolic poetry of Calpurnius and Nemesianus, but at a later date various hands
                  have obscured the transmitted text by erasing or emending to such a degree that
                  sometimes you can barely see what the original reading was. Moreover, because of
                  their similarities, I could not, like Schenkl, always distinguish the later hands.
                  That is why I have indicated all of them, except Angeli's readings, in the
                  apparatus criticus with the symbol <ref target="#ρ2">ρ²</ref>. For the hand of
                  Angeli is easily distinguished from the others in nearly all instances. And now we
                  must consider his readings to make a proper judgment about the authority of the
                  Codex Germanicus, since we learn nothing from the edition published in Parma
                  (around 1500) or the first Florentine edition (1504), even though Angeli edited
                  the latter and Angelo Ugoleto added at the end of the former that he had
                  established the text based on the Codex Germanicus, when both editions, as Schenkl
                  has demonstrated conclusively, derived from Codex Riccardianus 636.</p>
               <p>First to consider is whether all of the readings noted by Angeli were taken from
                  the Codex Germanicus or had some other origin. In the subcription of the Codex
                  Riccardianus <ref target="#Riccardianus636SubTrans">that we reported above</ref>
                  there is mention of many other manuscripts. Moreover, Angeli's annotations can be
                  divided generally into two classes, for most of them agree with N G, and the rest
                  with certain manuscripts of the second family, especially Codex Urbinas 353
                  Vatican 3152, Ambrosianus O.74 sup., and the edition published in Venice in 1472.

                     xml:lang="la">spectavimus</quote> Aκχ. In light of these facts, it seems very
                  close to the truth that the Codex Germanicus derived from the same archetype as N
                  and G, and that the readings that agree with N and G should be attributed to that
                  archetype, but that Angeli copied the rest of the readings from interpolated
                  manuscripts. This inference is supported by the fact that Angeli discloses in the
                  subscription to the Codex Riccardianus that he used other manuscripts, too. This
                  agrees with the fact that the four later poems were attributed to Nemesianus in
                  the Codex Germanicus, as attested by Niccolò Angeli at the end of Calpurnius in
                  the Codex Riccardianus and Angelo Ugoleto at the end of the original from Parma. N
                  and G divide the eleven eclogues between Calpurnius and Nemesianus in the same
                  way, but all of them are attributed to Calpurnius alone in the manuscripts of the
                  second family. Therefore the Codex Germanicus should certainly be assigned to the
                  first family. But could it not happen that the Codex Germanicus underwent some
                  interpolations? Indeed it could have happened, but since the task of seeking out a
                  semblance of the lost manuscript is a very risky venture, even though the
                  inference seems probable to me, I nevertheless prefer to report all of Angeli's
                  readings without distinction under the symbol <ref target="#A">A</ref>. And I feel
                  so strongly about the authority of the Codex Germanicus that when it agrees with N
                  or G, it offers us another witness to the first family, and when it agrees with V,
                  it has the same force as a manuscript of the second family. For Angeli's
                  annotations hardly ever differ from all of the manuscripts: Calp. 1.45 <quote
                     xml:lang="la">in ulnis</quote>, 1.86 <quote xml:lang="la">tralati</quote>, 2.3
                     <quote xml:lang="la">nec</quote>, 4.86 <quote xml:lang="la">in</quote>, 5.65
                     <quote xml:lang="la">tinniat ore</quote>, 5.79 <quote xml:lang="la">et
                     vitrosa</quote>, 5.104 <quote xml:lang="la">hic</quote>, 7.59 <quote
                     xml:lang="la">manticoram</quote>, Nemes. 1.70 <quote xml:lang="la"
                  >hinc</quote>, 2.41 <quote xml:lang="la">horti</quote>, 2.83 <quote xml:lang="la"
                     >qui</quote>. But sometimes the Codex Germanicus alone among all manuscripts
                  preserves for us the true reading or traces of the true reading, as at Calp. 2.3
                     <quote xml:lang="la">nec et</quote>, 5.65 <quote xml:lang="la">tinniat
                     ore</quote>. Finally, in the same Codex Riccardianus there are certain
                  corrections that cannot be attributed to Angeli, but doubtlessly descend from some
                  manuscript of the first family. Perhaps some corrector copied those, too, from the
                  Codex Germanicus.</p>
               <p xml:id="Boccaccio">Regarding Boccaccio's manuscript, truly the things that can be
                  said are few and uncertain. For although the Codex Harleianus, according to its
                  subscription, was collated with the Codex Germanicus, Boccaccio's manuscript, and
                  many others, for the most part the readings that Angelius did not note in the
                  Codex Riccardianus seem to go back to Boccaccio's manuscript. After carefully
                  inspecting these readings, we can conclude only this: that the manuscrupt that
                  Boccaccio is said to have written with his own hand must be assigned to the
                  so-called first family. Everything else is highly uncertain. As for the authority
                  of this manuscript, the same things that I said about the Codex Germanicus apply.
                  Finally, I think we should not overlook that in one place (Nemes. 4.70 <quote
                     xml:lang="la">quo</quote> Boccaccio's manuscript alone, out of all of the
                  manuscripts, displays the true reading.</p>

                  <p>Now I must discuss the excerpts. Two manuscripts in Paris (referred to together

                     have also some verses selected from Calpurnius' eclogues 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and a
                     few others from Nemesianus' fourth eclogue, attributed there to Calpurnius. For
                     in the Codex Thuaneus at the beginning of the first excerpt the following is
                     inscribed: <quote xml:lang="la">Calpurnius in bucolicis</quote>; in the Codex
                     Nostradamensis: <quote xml:lang="la">Scalpurius in bucolicis</quote>. But in
                     the latter, the corruption of the name traces its origin to the initial letter
                     of the first verse: <quote xml:lang="la">Satis hoc</quote> (2.23). These are
                     the fragments: Calp. 2.23 <quote xml:lang="la">satis</quote>-24, 3.10 <quote

                     1880. In 1909, I was the first to collate the excerpta Bononiensia.</p>
                  <p xml:id="ExcerptaTrans">Now let us discuss the worth of the excerpts. Certainly
                     the excerpta Bononiensia were copied from some manuscript of the second family.
                     Compare these passages: Nemes. 4.21 <quote xml:lang="la">eris–flores</quote> V
                     Exc. Bon., <quote xml:lang="la">(h)erit florem</quote> N G, 4.24 <quote

                        <quote xml:lang="la">annos</quote> N G. But the books in Paris have a better
                     reputation by far. In the following places N G Exc. Par. offer a good reading,
                     but V offers a bad one: Calp 4.14 <quote xml:lang="la">nunc</quote> N G Exc.

                     places V Exc. Par. preserve an attested reading that N G have corrupted: Calp.

                     Exc. Par., <quote xml:lang="la">(h)erit-florem</quote> N G. Moreover, in only
                     one place have the excerpta Parisina admitted the interpolations of the
                     inferior manuscripts: Calp. 5.12 <quote xml:lang="la">iamdudum</quote> pler. V
                     Exc. Par., <quote xml:lang="la">aetas iam</quote> N G. At Calp. 6.55 N and G
                     and the excerpts are different. Finally, they present some readings unique to
                     them: Calp. 4.15 <quote xml:lang="la">valeate</quote> Par. pr., 155 <quote
                        xml:lang="la">michi</quote>, 5.45 <quote xml:lang="la">erit;

                     said that all of the manuscripts that we have today must be traced back by
                     various paths to the same archetype, as their many errors in common indicate,
                     especially the lacuna and the confusion of verses in the amoebaean song in
                     Calpurnius' fourth eclogue. But that the excerpts about which we speak cannot
                     trace their origin further is supported by a single, but very strong argument
                     (cf. <bibl><author>H. Schenkl</author>, <title level="j">Wiener Studien</title>
